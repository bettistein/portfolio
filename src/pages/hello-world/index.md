In August 2017 I had the chance to do a chalk wall at the Berlin headquarter of tandem. Tandem is an app for mobile language exchange with over one million members and 2.500 language combinations.
I decided to use different phrases and words in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, Georgian, Albanian, Vietnamese, Latvian and Lithuanian.

For me it was such a great experience to letter words such as გამარჯობა or 歡迎.
All together it took me two days and a bunch of chalk pens to finish this mural.
Thanks so much tandem for this opportunity!
