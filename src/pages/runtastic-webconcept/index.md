As the current Landingpage is already a bit outdated brand-wise, and confusing for the user - the Runtastic Web and Brand Team got together to develop a new strategy and design.
The new landingpage will consist of 4 sections which will tell the user about the four main parts of Runtastic: Cardio, Training, Nutrition and Daily Habits.
