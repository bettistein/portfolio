        My name is Betty, I am a Digital Designer based in Vienna, Austria.
        After working for several years as a full-stack designer, I developed a
        passion for Branding, UI Design,
        and fun Illustrations.
        I take the time to understand your strategy, stakeholders and audiences
        and bring my experience and insights to the table.

        Previously I had a great time as Head of Brand Design
        with the talented people from Runtastic.
