### Designing the logo:

The Logotype is inspired by "Egytienne" fonts which signifiy the interest of Europeans in ancient Egypt during the nineteenth century.
The Brand Mark consists of two elements â€“ 1. the camel and 2. the star. The camel represents the OCaml programming language in a metaphorical way. 
The star functions as a symbol of growth and protection, which emphasizes the mission of the Ocaml Software Foundation.
