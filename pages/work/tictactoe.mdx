Just a side project?  Creating work for my clients or employers as a designer
can be quite fulfillig. But I believe that everyone who is already in the
industry for a couple of years come to a point where one has the feeling to do
the same things over and over again. Where are the new and innovative ideas,
the creative and disruptive designs?

How to get your creative juices flowing again? Finding back to the creative
spirit?  The answer is quite simple: I get out of my comfort-zone. Trying
things, I wouldn't do in a regular job (because risk of failure)

I've never done a web-app before. So why not teaching myself everything about
it I need to know and creating one? Responsive of course. Contemporary design.
Talking to programmers who are enthusiastic enough to give advice, and are
willing to implement it.
