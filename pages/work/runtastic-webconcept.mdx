}

As the current Landingpage is already a bit outdated brand-wise, and confusing
for the user - the Runtastic Web and Brand Team got together to develop a new
strategy and design.  The new landingpage will consist of 4 sections which
will tell the user about the four main parts of Runtastic: Cardio, Training,
Nutrition and Daily Habits.

By the way, we also updated the Runtastic some time ago, read more about it on
the [Runtastic
Blog](https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/new-runtastic-logo-same-awesome-us-yes-that-includes-you/)

In the beginning of my 5 year Runtastic career, 
I've also done some UI Design for Apps. You can find out more about them on a <a href="/">seperat page.</a>
