## About

My name is Betty, I am a Digital Designer based in Vienna, Austria. After working for several years as a full-stack designer, I developed a passion for Branding, UI Design, and fun Illustrations. I take the time to understand your strategy, stakeholders and audiences and bring my experience and insights to the table.
Previously I had a great time as Head of Brand Design with the talented people from Runtastic.

IÂ´m always looking for new adventures & friends, so feel free to send me a message.
