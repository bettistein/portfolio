          <p>
            My name is Betty, I am a Digital Designer based in Vienna, Austria.
            After working for several years as a full-stack designer, I
            developed a passion for Branding, UI Design, and fun Illustrations.
            I take the time to understand your strategy, stakeholders and
            audiences and bring my experience and insights to the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously I had a great time as Head of Brand Design with the
            talented people from Runtastic.

            IÂ´m always looking for new adventures & friends, so feel free to
            send me a message.
